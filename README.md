## 🤔 **What is it?**

**_kleur_** is a way to give Framer X a more personal touch by allowing **you** to apply themes on a per-project basis. Ever wanted to replace that default blue with a light shade of mint green? You can do that in less than a minute!

## 💭 **What does** **_kleur_** **mean?**

The word **_kleur_** is Dutch for _color_. Why Dutch? Well, because I was born in the Netherlands, and because Framer is based in Amsterdam. _( fun fact of the day_ 😋 _)_

## 👌 **Sounds cool! But how do I use it?**

Simple.  
All you need to do is download the [**_kleur_** package from the **Framer Store**](https://store.framer.com/package/lucasritter/kleur) place the **_kleur_** component somewhere in your canvas, attach a theme to the **Theme** property in the side panel and enable it 😎

Want to make your own themes?  
Follow the documentation on the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/lucasritter/kleur/wiki).

## 🎨 **Where can I find themes?**

Themes are available in the [kleur theme gallery](https://github.com/lucasritter/kleur/wiki/themes).  
Create a pull request if you want to get your theme added 😉❤️
