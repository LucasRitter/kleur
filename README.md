## 🤔 **What is it?**

**_kleur_** is a way to give Framer X a more personal touch by allowing **you** to apply themes on a per-project basis. Ever wanted to replace that default blue with a light shade of mint green? You can do that in less than a minute!

## 💭 **What does** **_kleur_** **mean?**

The word **_kleur_** is Dutch for _color_. Why Dutch? Well, because I was born in the Netherlands, and because Framer is based in Amsterdam. _( fun fact of the day_ 😋 _)_

## 👌 **Sounds cool! But how do I use it?**

**Easy.** There's only 3 steps:

#### Step ☝️

Download the **_kleur_** package from the [Framer Store](https://store.framer.com/package/lucasritter/kleur).

#### Step ✌️

Place the **_kleur_** component somewhere in your canvas and enable it.

#### Step 🤟

Load the desired theme file using the **_kleur_** component. 🌈

## 🎨 **Where can I find themes?**
