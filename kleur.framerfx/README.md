## ⚠️ **Before you continue**
This is a **very experimental** package. Not everything works yet. Anything you see can and will probably change in the future. 

## 🤔 **What is it?** 
***kleur*** is a way to give Framer X a more personal touch by allowing **you** to apply themes on a per-project basis. Ever wanted to replace that blue with a light shade of mint green? You can do that in less than a minute!

## 💭 **What does** ***kleur*** **mean?**
The word ***kleur*** is Dutch for *color*. Why Dutch? Well, because I was born in the the Netherlands, and because Framer is based in Amsterdam. *( fun fact of the day* 😋 *)*

## 👌 **Sounds cool! But how do I use it?**
Simple.  
All you need to do is place the ***kleur*** component somewhere in your canvas, attach a theme to the **Theme** property in the side panel and enable it 😎

Create a pull request if you want to get your theme added 😉❤️
